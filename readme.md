# CodingBat - IB Pseudocode version

A static website to do CodingBat problems in IB-Style pseudocode (javascript will also be accepted, but for that you should really go to the original CodingJS or CodingTS sites linked below)

The site is deployed at https://graded-cs-resources.github.io/CodingBatPseudo/

## Alternative, similar sites for different languages

- [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com) - the original, where you can do many of these problems plus more in java or python
- [CodingJS](https://github.com/the-winter/CodingJS) - CodingJS, a javascript implementation of codingbat problems 
- [CodingTS](https://github.com/graded-cs-resources/CodingTS) - CodingTS, an expansion of CodingJS with more of a typescript focus and more solutions

Thanks to [nodingbat](https://github.com/omariio/nodingbat) and [mirandaio/codingbat](https://github.com/mirandaio/codingbat) for providing some solutions and [codingbat](codingbat.com) for providing problems. Thanks to  [the-winter](https://github.com/the-winter) for his amazing [CodingJS](https://github.com/the-winter) app that provided the leap off point for this. And thanks to [Dave Mulkey](http://ibcomp.fis.edu/), IB Computer science teacher who built the [PseudoCode simulator](http://ibcomp.fis.edu/pseudocode/pcode.html) whose code I scraped for hints on how to get this working.
